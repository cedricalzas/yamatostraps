# Leather goods directly from Japan## 
[DSC03840.JPG](/uploads/DSC03840.JPG)

Yamato is the ancient Japan's name. The concept of the brand is to make leather goods with only made in Japan greatest materials.
I'm a hobbyist located in Japan making essentially watch straps and wallets with the best japanese leather around.
Japan has a great leather culture and history, and I would like to share it with my creations.
I love making custom order so don't hesitate to drop me a message of what are your needs and I will be happy to make your perfect item.

Shinki Hikaku cordovan or Leder Ogawa strap 100% handmade in Japan . I use 100% made in Japan best materials I could find and traditionnal japanese leather crafting tools for making those.

Dimensions are: about 80mm for the short side and 120mm for the long side.
Thickness is about 4mm at the lugs and 3mm at the end of the strap.
Color: dark green with beige stitching and burnished edges.

Cordovan is also called the king of leather, or the diamond of leather. It's super resistant while being supple and comfortable with a lot of richness in its color that play with lightning. Shinki Hikaku and Leder Ogawa  are  internationally well known cordovan tanners from Himeji and Tokyo, Japan. They make one of the best cordovan you can find.
I use Shonan vegetable-tanned leather for the under layer of the strap. This leather is maybe the most traditionnaly tanned calf leather in Japan, pretty soft and durable.
The thread I use is one of the most advanced nylon based thread heavily used by japanese leather crafters. Saddle stitched by hand.
The edges are sanded and burnished several times.

Feel free to contact me for customization!
